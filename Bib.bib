	Abstract = {High-integrity software systems are often so large that conventional development processes cannot get anywhere near achieving
tolerable defect rates. This article presents an approach that has delivered software with very low defect rates cost-effectively.
We describe the technical details of the approach and the results achieved, and discuss how to overcome barriers to adopting
such best practice approaches. We conclude by observing that where such approaches are compatible and can be deployed in
combination, we have the opportunity to realize the extremely low defect rates needed for high integrity software composed of
many million lines of code.},

@article{QuickCheck,
   Abstract = {QuickCheck is a tool which aids the Haskell programmer in
formulating and testing properties of programs. Properties are described as Haskell
functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible
to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which 
the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random
testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be 
stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components,
then random testing suffces to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.},
