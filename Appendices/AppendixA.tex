As shown in figure \ref{fig:AsyncInterface} the interface has three lines: 
value, ready, and acknowledge. The interface connects a Sender and Receiver.

Data is sent on the \(value\) line, and the \(ready\) and \(acknowledge\) lines are
used for synchronization. The sender puts a value on the \(value\) line. The 
\(ready\) line is then switched. When the receiver has read the value the 
\(acknowledge\) line is switched.
