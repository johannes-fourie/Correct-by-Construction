\section{Code contracts}

Code contracts are an application of Hoare logic. Using Hoare logic
we can show that a program correctly implements a specification if, given a set of 
preconditions derived from the specification, the program never violates a set of
post conditions derived from the specification. We use the Hoare triple to 
represent the contract \parencite{BasisForProgramming}:

\[
	\{P\}Q\{R\}
\]

where:
\begin{description}
	\item [$P$] are the preconditions;
	\item [$Q$] is the program;
	\item [$R$] are the postconditions.
\end{description}
