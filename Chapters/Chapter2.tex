\section{Manifesto for Agile Software Development}

The manifesto sets out the overarching principles of agile software development \parencite{Beck2001ManifestoFA}:

\begin{displayquote}
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping 
others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Individuals and interactions} \textit{over} processes and tools 
	\item \textbf{Working software} \textit{over} comprehensive documentation 
	\item \textbf{Customer collaboration} \textit{over} contract negotiation 
	\item \textbf{Responding to change} \textit{over} following a plan 
\end{itemize}

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on
the left more.
\end{displayquote}

\section{Correct by Construction development workflow}

The main properties of the CbyC development process are  \parencite{Tokeneer}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item each life-cycle phase can be validated;
	\item the semantic gap between life-cycle phases are reduced, making it possible
		to show the conformance of later life-cycle phases with earlier phases.
\end{itemize}

The CbyC development process products are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CbyCDev}.
