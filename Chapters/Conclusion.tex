Correct by Construction puts allot of emphasis on formal methods as a technique
and follows a design-and-implement process. The formal methods ensure that bugs 
are caught early in the design process before anything is build. 

Agile Scrum proposes a create-and-review process. Work is subdivided into 
self-contained parts that can be implemented separately. This helps ensure that
we always have functional software, even if it is minimal functionality.

Agile Scrum focuses more on the process and how to organise our team and work.
We augment the Agile Scrum process with the formal methods technique described 
by the Correct by Construction methodology.

By using the Correct by Construction Agile Scrum methodology we created, we no 
have a methodology that produces designs that can be proven correct while also 
delivering functional software in a timely manner.

The next step would be to apply this proposed methodology on a real world project.
This will allow us to see how much time it takes for a team to learn the new tools 
and languages and how the methodology impacts the software delivery schedule 
and the software's reliability.
